We’re thrilled to have you on board and are committed to ensuring that your time with us is both enriching and enjoyable. Within the organisational structure, CAMARADES Berlin is positioned within the QUEST Center for Responsible Research, which is in the Berlin Institute of Health, a pillar of Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin. This cookbook draws inspiration from a fantastic editorial in Nature (The key to a happy lab life is in the manual) and owes much to the insights of others, notably the Blueprint Team from CAMARADES Canada and the team at CAMARADES Edinburgh. Founded in 2004 by Malcolm Macleod and David Howells, CAMARADES is dedicated to tackling translational hurdles in preclinical stroke research through systematic review and meta-analysis. Over the years, our scope has expanded to encompass review of other areas including neuropathic pain and Alzheimer’s disease, and types of research such as in vitro. More recently our work has also investigated metaresearch more broadly and research improvement. At CAMARADES, we’ve been at the forefront of preclinical systematic review, conducting our research and providing invaluable support to other research groups engaged in systematic review endeavours. Our collaborative ethos extends globally, fostering partnerships with researchers worldwide, including meta-researchers, preclinical researchers, clinicians, pharmaceutical companies, publishers, funders, and policymakers. Upon joining our team, it’s essential to familiarise yourself with this cookbook. We understand it’s comprehensive, so feel free to digest it gradually over your initial days with us. We expect you to be acquainted with its contents and to refer back to it as needed. Should you require clarification on any aspect of the cookbook, don’t hesitate to engage with your fellow team members. While this manual serves as a foundational resource, fostering a positive experience will also involve active engagement and ongoing refinement of our interactions. Remember, this cookbook is a living document. Your input matters, so if you have suggestions for additions or clarifications, please share them with the team.

While you may have already notified us in advance, keeping track of everyone’s movements can be challenging, and we use the group calendar to help us stay informed of your whereabouts. Additionally, enabling your out-of-office auto-response will help notify colleagues of your absence, ensuring smooth communication within the team. 2.3 Work-life balance 2.4 Professional development 2.5 Academic citizenship 2.6 Social activities "],["the-team.html", "Chapter 3 The team 3.1 Name", " Chapter 3 The team The CAMARADES Berlin team is led by Sarah. We pride ourselves on being a diverse team, bringing together expertise that spans across various disciplines including clinical medicine, basic science, data science, and software engineering. This diverse blend of backgrounds and skills enables us to approach our research from multiple perspectives. 3.1 Name Role: Email: your.email@bih-charite.de Key projects: project1, project2 "],["communication.html", "Chapter 4 Communication 4.1 Internal communications 4.2 Group meetings 4.3 Mailing lists", " Chapter 4 Communication 4.1 Internal communications 4.2 Group meetings 4.3 Mailing lists "],["file-management.html", "Chapter 5 File management 5.1 Storage 5.2 File organisation 5.3 Folder organisation 5.4 Data documentation 5.5 Version control using GitHub", " Chapter 5 File management We aim for data organisation to be clear and as consistent as possible between projects – to help with locating files, prevent data loss, and ensure that data can be findable, accessible, and used/re-used (both by yourself and others in the team). To ensure consistent data organisation across projects, we recommend following the principles below: 5.1 Storage All CAMARADES projects data and documents should be stored on CAMARADES Berlin SharePoint as the primary location rather than on a local computer or personal accounts. You receive access to this when your contract starts. Generally for new projects, a folder should be creatred within ‘General’ in CAMARADES SharePoint. The exception would be for projects involving other organisations (where there may have been agreement to store/share data elsewhere), projects with sensitive data, or projects with existing folders within the main CAMARADES SharePoint directory. Sensitive data such as interview recordings should only be stored on the Charité-managed S-drive (AG McCann / CAMARADES Berlin). Depending on data/file being stored, you may wish to routinely create backups elsewhere, e.g. OSF for documents/data; GitHub for code. 5.1.1 Folder structure on SharePoint (proposal to discuss) Education General admin, CAMARADES global, logos/templates, misc projects, presentations, conferences, writing retreats etc Grants applications, grant admin, documentation/info from funders, list of funding opportunities Methods support Projects one folder per project (COReS, INFORM, attac, sex diff, stroke comorb, in vitro, etc) 5.2 File organisation File naming convention: ProjectName_FileDescription_Date_Version[Draft/Final] e.g. StrokeComorb_invitroProtocol_2023-01-26_v02Draft.docx General rules: Don’t use overly long filenames, use the minimum characters to include enough descriptive information in a filename Avoid special characters such as &amp;*%$£°{! @ which can be reserved for specific tasks depending on the operating systems Use the underscore character instead of the point or the space, the latter two being able to be interpreted differently according to the operating systems Include as much descriptive information as possible to help identify the file, regardless of where it is stored Include the date in all file names, formatted according to the international standard ISO 8601: YYYY-MM-DD (year-month-day) The version number of a record should be indicated in its file name by the inclusion of ‘v’ followed the version number (2 digit format) and, where applicable, ‘Draft’ or ‘Final’. Rather consider that the applications and instruments that could access the files are not case sensitive. In other words, consider by default that DATA and Data and data are identical. Use extensions (.xls, .ssd, .txt, etc.) in all lowercase (I.e., do not use .PDF or .Pdf) whenever possible to meaningfully reflect the software environment in which the file was created. Avoid keeping all intermediate versions of the same file. Too many different versions of the same file can be confusing to you and others. 5.3 Folder organisation 5.4 Data documentation 5.5 Version control using GitHub For SR projects involving programming, maintain at least one active Github repository per project on camaradesberlin with scripts and version control. Access can be set to private. NB: be careful with sensitive information when uploading to GitHub. Store any configuration/credential details separately and do not upload this to GitHub.

We are constantly adding new info to the wiki (thanks to Friederike’s initiative of a monthly Wiki happy hour), so if something you think is relevant is missing you are more than welcome to add it yourself. If the answer you are looking for is not on the wiki, you can email Ruth (ruth.woelpert@bih-charite.de) or Gabriela (gabriela.seidel@bih-charite.de) to ask for clarification. 6.2 Common CAMARADES resources and acronyms To familiarize yourself with our ongoing projects you can check our research group’s page on the QUEST wiki. There you will find the acronyms we use for each project (which you will be hearing a lot in our meetings), which team member(s) work on which project, and monthly project updates. Other than that, here is a list of common tools/software we use you should get familiar with and create user accounts for where necessary. SR&amp;MA: systematic review and meta-analysis ASySD: Automated deduplicator tool for removing duplicates across systematic searches, developed in-house. SOLES: Systematic Online Living Evidence Summaries, a pipeline and dashboard summarising the latest research findings in a given research area. We have developed many SOLES for different evidence domains (e.g. Cancer-SOLES, Stroke-SOLES) SyRF: Our in-house systematic review platform. We use it for screening for inclusion and extracting information and data from publications. GitHub: Central platform for code sharing and collaboration on various projects. SharePoint: We use sharepoint to manage our files and folders. This is accessible via Teams by going to the “Files” tab or from the browser. You will find all the necessary files there, and you should upload all the files you work on there regularly (when doing so, please adhere to file naming conventions described in chapter X Data Management). Teams: We use Microsoft Teams for onlinmeetings and file-management. You will get an invite to join on your first day. Zulip: An open-source messaging app for better team communication and collaboration. We use this for our daily internal communication but also to communicate with the wider COReS network (check what COReS is about on wiki!). You will get an invite to join on your first day. 6.3 Training/reading list We have summarized some useful links and resources covering different steps of preclinical systematic review in our CAMARADES Berlin wiki. To get a detailed overview of the systematic review method, we recommend attending one of our Introduction to SR&amp;MA of Animal Studies workshop which we run several times per year, or if no workshop is happening anytime soon, we recommend going over the materials at your own pace using our eLearning course. All info on signing up for either is available in the CAMARADES Berlin wiki. Project specific literature that you should get yourself familiar with can be found in sharepoint in the respective project’s folder. Also check out an extensive list of recommended resources from CAMARADES Edinburgh.
