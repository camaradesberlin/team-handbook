We’re thrilled to have you on board and are committed to ensuring that your time with us is both enriching and enjoyable. Within the organisational structure, CAMARADES Berlin is positioned within the QUEST Center for Responsible Research, which is in the Berlin Institute of Health, a pillar of Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin. This cookbook draws inspiration from a fantastic editorial in Nature (The key to a happy lab life is in the manual) and owes much to the insights of others, notably the Blueprint Team from CAMARADES Canada and the team at CAMARADES Edinburgh. Founded in 2004 by Malcolm Macleod and David Howells, CAMARADES is dedicated to tackling translational hurdles in preclinical stroke research through systematic review and meta-analysis. Over the years, our scope has expanded to encompass review of other areas including neuropathic pain and Alzheimer’s disease, and types of research such as in vitro. More recently our work has also investigated metaresearch more broadly and research improvement. At CAMARADES, we’ve been at the forefront of preclinical systematic review, conducting our research and providing invaluable support to other research groups engaged in systematic review endeavours. Our collaborative ethos extends globally, fostering partnerships with researchers worldwide, including meta-researchers, preclinical researchers, clinicians, pharmaceutical companies, publishers, funders, and policymakers. Upon joining our team, it’s essential to familiarise yourself with this cookbook. We understand it’s comprehensive, so feel free to digest it gradually over your initial days with us. We expect you to be acquainted with its contents and to refer back to it as needed. Should you require clarification on any aspect of the cookbook, don’t hesitate to engage with your fellow team members. While this manual serves as a foundational resource, fostering a positive experience will also involve active engagement and ongoing refinement of our interactions. Remember, this cookbook is a living document. Your input matters, so if you have suggestions for additions or clarifications, please share them with the team.

While you may have already notified us in advance, keeping track of everyone’s movements can be challenging, and we use the group calendar to help us stay informed of your whereabouts. Additionally, enabling your out-of-office auto-response will help notify colleagues of your absence, ensuring smooth communication within the team. 2.3 Work-life balance 2.4 Professional development 2.5 Academic citizenship 2.6 Social activities "],["the-team.html", "Chapter 3 The team 3.1 Name", " Chapter 3 The team The CAMARADES Berlin team is led by Sarah. We pride ourselves on being a diverse team, bringing together expertise that spans across various disciplines including clinical medicine, basic science, data science, and software engineering. This diverse blend of backgrounds and skills enables us to approach our research from multiple perspectives. 3.1 Name Role: Email: your.email@bih-charite.de Key projects: project1, project2 "],["communication.html", "Chapter 4 Communication 4.1 Internal communications 4.2 External communications 4.3 Group meetings 4.4 Mailing lists", " Chapter 4 Communication Efective teamwork begins and ends with communication Mike Krzyzewski (former US basketball coach) 4.1 Internal communications Zulip and email are our main channels for written communication within the team. MS Teams is our primary channel for online meetings. During regular work hours it is recommended to be logged in to Zulip as well as MS Teams. We recommend using the MS Teams desktop app for optimal use. Please note: The Zulip desktop app cannot be downloaded and installed on Charité/BIH managed computers. Some tasks, such as writing a paper during our CAMARADES writing retreats, require concentration and minimizing disctractions (e.g., by checking emails or messages on Zulip or Teams). Feel free to set your status on Teams accordingly by indicating that you are ‘busy’ or ‘away from the computer’. You do not indicate this specifically on Zulip, as it will automatically show you as ‘idle’ when you are not active. 4.2 External communications Aside from emails for regular external communications, we are using LinkedIn (via COReS profile) and Zulip. * For content to be posted via LinkedIn, please reach out to Friederike. * On Zulip, you can use different streams to reach people. Use the SR_Methods stream to post and discuss methodological questions related to systematic reviews, while you can use the Education stream to share workshops, eLearning, training opportunities and oder educational offers. Announce events, meetings, and conferences that might be of interest to a wider audience va the General stream (topic: Events). 4.3 Group meetings Every Thursday @ 1:00pm: CAMARADES Berlin Strategy Meeting Alternating between short (30’) and long (90’) meetings Team members share updates, potential problems, work distributions, etc. A specific overarching topic (such as ‘engagement and dissemination strategy’ or ‘education formats’) will be discussed during the longer group meeting Every Tuesday @ 10:30am or 3:00pm (alternating between weeks): CAMARADES Global Tuesday Meeting The idea of the CAMARADES Global meeting is to foster collaboration among CAMARADES members from seven national coordinating centers and with others involved in preclinical systematic review and meta-analysis. The meetings provide an opportunity to ask methodological questions or receive input from peers. The meetings are scheduled as one of two formats: General update meetings, where everyone is invited to share recent news or ask for feedback on particular issues, or Presentation meetings, where a member will make a short presentation followed by discussion. Slides and short summaries of the presentation meetings will be shared via Zulip (stream: CAMARADES Global, topic: Global Meetings) 4.4 Mailing lists Make sure that you are signed up for the CAMARADES Global maling list. If you are not, please contact Sarah and ask to be added to the list.

There are different options to safe files for employees. The location to where we store data depends on who is supposed to be using it and whether it entails sensitive data. In general, CAMARADES commits to an open and collaborative working attitude. Therefore, we safe most of our files either in a cloud storage or in an open repository such as osf.io or github. Most of our data are stored on the [CAMARADES sharepoint] (https://charitede.sharepoint.com/sites/StrokeCoMorb). Sensitive data containing information that might be sensitive (patient data but also contracts) should not be safed on the sharepoint. The BIH offers servers to store data which receive a regular backup. Please contact other team members to discuss whether any data you produce or store should be safed there. For private data, you can either use the onedrive cloud service connected to your Charité e-mail address or use the Charité t: Server connected to your computer. You are the only one who can access the data there. Never safe data on any device provided to you by the BIH as sometimes the IT helpdesk might have to install something or recover your computer. There is no backup on your work computer. To ensure consistent data organisation across projects, we recommend following the principles below: 5.2 Storage All CAMARADES projects data and documents should be stored on CAMARADES Berlin SharePoint as the primary location rather than on a local computer or personal accounts. You receive access to this when your contract starts. Generally for new projects, a folder should be created within ‘General’ in CAMARADES SharePoint. The exception would be for projects involving other organisations (where there may have been agreement to store/share data elsewhere), projects with sensitive data, or projects with existing folders within the main CAMARADES SharePoint directory. Sensitive data such as interview recordings should only be stored on the Charité-managed S-drive (AG McCann / CAMARADES Berlin). Depending on data/file being stored, you may wish to routinely create backups elsewhere, e.g. OSF for documents/data; GitHub for code. 5.2.1 Folder structure on SharePoint (proposal to discuss) Education General admin, CAMARADES global, logos/templates, misc projects, presentations, conferences, writing retreats etc Grants applications, grant admin, documentation/info from funders, list of funding opportunities Methods support Projects one folder per project (COReS, INFORM, attac, sex diff, stroke comorb, in vitro, etc) 5.3 File organisation 5.3.1 File naming convention ProjectName_FileDescription_Date_Version[Draft/Final] or ProjectName_FileDescriptor_YYYY-MM-DD_VersionNumber e.g. StrokeComorb_invitroProtocol_2023-01-26_v02Draft.docx 5.3.2 General rules Don’t use overly long filenames, use the minimum characters to include enough descriptive information in a filename Avoid special characters such as &amp;*%$£°{! @ which can be reserved for specific tasks depending on the operating systems Use the underscore character instead of the point or the space, the latter two being able to be interpreted differently according to the operating systems Include as much descriptive information as possible to help identify the file, regardless of where it is stored Include the date in all file names, formatted according to the international standard ISO 8601: YYYY-MM-DD (year-month-day) The version number of a record should be indicated in its file name by the inclusion of ‘v’ followed the version number (2 digit format) and, where applicable, ‘Draft’ or ‘Final’. Rather consider that the applications and instruments that could access the files are not case sensitive. In other words, consider by default that DATA and Data and data are identical. Use extensions (.xls, .ssd, .txt, etc.) in all lowercase (I.e., do not use .PDF or .Pdf) whenever possible to meaningfully reflect the software environment in which the file was created. Avoid keeping all intermediate versions of the same file. Too many different versions of the same file can be confusing to you and others. 5.4 Folder organisation 5.4.1 General rules How files are organised within folders depends mainly on the type of project. Nevertheless, it is recommended to follow the following principles to standardise file management across project and make it easier for everyone in the team to navigate any project’s directory. 5.4.2 Systematic review projects 5.4.3 Coding Proposed structure for folders involving R programming: data folder – store all your data used in your scripts here and read from it. output folder – write files to this folder; you may subcategorise by type of files (e.g., csv, figures), or by date created folder with main script .R file(s); annotate steps in your R scripts so that others can understand and use it. If writing functions, for each function, annotate (i) purpose of the function, (ii) input variables (including type of variable), (iii) what does the function returns. If there are multiple .R files within a folder, include a README file that summarises purpose for each script. “R” folder (optional) to store ‘configure.R’ files containing configuration info shared across scripts for the project +/- scripts containing functions which will be called by different scripts across the project 5.5 Data documentation (to be discussed) Ensure that there is appropriate documentation at level of project (living project document and protocol), file (living project document +/- README - explanation of the files in your folder, how they relate to each other) and variable/item (README files containing explanation of columns and data fields in a spreadsheet). 5.6 Version control using GitHub For SR projects involving programming, maintain at least one active Github repository per project on camaradesberlin with scripts and version control. Access can be set to private. NB: be careful with sensitive information when uploading to GitHub. Store any configuration/credential details separately and do not upload this to GitHub.

We are constantly adding new info to the wiki (thanks to Friederike’s initiative of a monthly Wiki happy hour), so if something you think is relevant is missing you are more than welcome to add it yourself. If the answer you are looking for is not on the wiki, you can email Ruth (ruth.woelpert@bih-charite.de) or Gabriela (gabriela.seidel@bih-charite.de) to ask for clarification. 6.2 Common CAMARADES resources and acronyms To familiarize yourself with our ongoing projects you can check our research group’s page on the QUEST wiki. There you will find the acronyms we use for each project (which you will be hearing a lot in our meetings), which team member(s) work on which project, and monthly project updates. Other than that, here is a list of common tools/software we use you should get familiar with and create user accounts for where necessary. SR&amp;MA: systematic review and meta-analysis ASySD: Automated deduplicator tool for removing duplicates across systematic searches, developed in-house. SOLES: Systematic Online Living Evidence Summaries, a pipeline and dashboard summarising the latest research findings in a given research area. We have developed many SOLES for different evidence domains (e.g. Cancer-SOLES, Stroke-SOLES) SyRF: Our in-house systematic review platform. We use it for screening for inclusion and extracting information and data from publications. GitHub: Central platform for code sharing and collaboration on various projects. SharePoint: We use sharepoint to manage our files and folders. This is accessible via Teams by going to the “Files” tab or from the browser. You will find all the necessary files there, and you should upload all the files you work on there regularly (when doing so, please adhere to file naming conventions described in chapter X Data Management). Teams: We use Microsoft Teams for onlinmeetings and file-management. You will get an invite to join on your first day. Zulip: An open-source messaging app for better team communication and collaboration. We use this for our daily internal communication but also to communicate with the wider COReS network (check what COReS is about on wiki!). You will get an invite to join on your first day. 6.3 Training/reading list We have summarized some useful links and resources covering different steps of preclinical systematic review in our CAMARADES Berlin wiki. To get a detailed overview of the systematic review method, we recommend attending one of our Introduction to SR&amp;MA of Animal Studies workshop which we run several times per year, or if no workshop is happening anytime soon, we recommend going over the materials at your own pace using our eLearning course. All info on signing up for either is available in the CAMARADES Berlin wiki. Project specific literature that you should get yourself familiar with can be found in sharepoint in the respective project’s folder. Also check out an extensive list of recommended resources from CAMARADES Edinburgh. "],["how-to.html", "Chapter 7 How to 7.1 Contribute to this handbook 7.2 Use the R functions available on CAMARADES Berlin GitHub 7.3 Use Git/GitHub in Rstudio for version control", " Chapter 7 How to 7.1 Contribute to this handbook The easiest way to edit the team handbook is via the GitHub user interface. Navigate to the webpage of the public repository. Click on the .Rmd file you want to edit. Keep in mind that each .Rmd file corresponds to one chapter. The welcome page text is found in index.Rmd, while all other files are named after the corresponding chapter e.g. 01-group-culture.Rmd or 02-team.Rmd. Click on ‘Edit this file’. Add/edit content of file. The easiest way to do this is to write plain text and use simple Markdown syntax for formatting (e.g., to add (sub)headings, format italics or bold, add hyperlinks or pictures, bullet points etc). If unsure, you could have a look at how other files of the handbook are formatted or consult this or this Markdown cheat sheet. Please don’t hesitate to ask for support from the team if there any issues/questions. Once you’re happy with your changes click the ‘Commit changes’ button. You will be prompted to add a commit message. This should be a short and ideally informative message about the changes you’ve made to the file. A more detailed description can optionally be provided in the box below. To finalize your edits click on the ‘Commit changes’ button. 7.2 Use the R functions available on CAMARADES Berlin GitHub 7.2.1 Getting started Open Rstudio and create a new project using the following steps: File &gt; New project &gt; Version control &gt; Git For repository URL add the link to the GitHub repository: (https://github.com/camaradesberlin/tools). Choose where you want this folder to be created and click on ‘Create project’. Install the pacman package if you haven’t already. This will take care of loading the right libraries for the functions. You can do this by typing the following in the R console: install.packages(\"pacman\") Load the function(s) you want to run. Currently, the functions are stored in separate scripts. Have a look at the repository webpage for more information on what each function does and input/output details. For example, if you want to run the function to retrieve retraction information, type the following in the console: source(\"get_retractions.R\") get_retractions(\"path/to/citations.csv\") 7.2.2 Get the latest version of the functions in case of updates Open Rstudio and load the project: File &gt; Open Project In the Environment pane, click on the Git tab and then on the ‘Pull’ blue arrow pointing down. This will update your local repository with any changes made on the remote repository (GitHub). Load the function(s) as described in the section above. 7.3 Use Git/GitHub in Rstudio for version control 7.3.1 Getting started Create a personal GitHub account at https://github.com/join if you don’t already have one. Ask one of the team members to add you to the admin team of our CAMARADES Berlin GitHub 7.3.1.1 Git configuration The next step is to set up your user information so you can start using git. You can use the package usethis to do this in R. Note that the e-mail address you provide should be one that is associated with your GitHub account. # install.packages(&quot;usethis&quot;) library(usethis) use_git_config(user.name = &quot;yourname&quot;, user.email = &quot;youremail@example.org&quot;) 7.3.1.2 Personal access tokens (PATs) Certain actions, such as pushing changes to GitHub or cloning a repository need user authentication. Your GitHub user password is not an accepted way to do this anymore, which means you have to generate another type of authentication credential. This is known as the personal access token (PAT). If you don’t already have a PAT, you can generate one by calling usethis::create_github_token() in R. This will lead you to github.com on the PAT generation form. Make sure you select all the appropriate scopes for this particular token (keep defaults if unsure), before clicking on Generate Token. You won’t be able to see this token again, so copy it to clipboard and don’t close the browser window until you have stored it locally! One approach is to store your PAT in .Renviron so that it is made available to GitHub and you won’t have to re-enter your credentials every time you need authentication. Call usethis::edit_r_environ() and then add a line like this substituting your PAT: GITHUB_PAT=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx. Alternatively, the package gitcreds can be used to store and implicitly retrieve your PATs (recommended). gitcreds::gitcreds_set() will prompt you to provide your newly generated PAT. 7.3.2 GitHub/RStudio workflow 7.3.2.1 Clone the GitHub repository Next, you will want to clone (i.e. create a local copy of) the target repository so you can work locally. In RStudio, go to File &gt; New project &gt; Version control &gt; Git. Enter the details of the repository you want to clone e.g. the team handbook public repository and click on Create project. If no credentials are stored, you might be prompted to provide your GitHub username and password when cloning the repository. The PAT should be used here, not your GitHub user account password. See section above on how to generate and store a PAT for future use. 7.3.2.2 Commit changes While editing and files in your local repository, it’s not enough to just save these files locally. You will also reguarly want to commit these changes, which means that different versions will be stored in the git directory as you go along. This creates a history of your edits and can help you track progress or even revert back to an older script if needed. Once you’ve edited your local files and you are ready to commit these changes, click on Commit in the Git tab. In the pop-up window you will be able to select which files you want to include in this commit, along with a concise and informative message about what has changed. Once you are ready, click Commit. It’s generally helpful for yourself and collaborators you try to limit each commit to specific features/thematic tasks/fixes. 7.3.2.3 Pull/Push changes Pulling and pushing are actions that allow your local branch (your own computer) and the corresponding branch in the remote repository (GitHub) to communicate. When you want to update your local repository with changes made by others, you pull the changes from the remote repository using git pull. To send (or push) the changes and commits made in your local repository to the remote one, you use the git push command. In RStudio, you can do these actions by using the corresponding Push and Pull buttons found in the Git tab. Alternatively, the following command in the terminal will push commits made in your local branch to the corresponding remote one: git push origin &lt;branch-name&gt; 7.3.3 Collaborative workflow "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed). You may want to try searching to find the page's new location, or use the table of contents to find the page you are looking for. "]]
