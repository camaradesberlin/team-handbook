We’re thrilled to have you on board and are committed to ensuring that your time with us is both enriching and enjoyable. Within the organisational structure, CAMARADES Berlin is positioned within the QUEST Center for Responsible Research, which is in the Berlin Institute of Health, a pillar of Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin. This cookbook draws inspiration from a fantastic editorial in Nature (The key to a happy lab life is in the manual) and owes much to the insights of others, notably the Blueprint Team from CAMARADES Canada and the team at CAMARADES Edinburgh. Founded in 2004 by Malcolm Macleod and David Howells, CAMARADES is dedicated to tackling translational hurdles in preclinical stroke research through systematic review and meta-analysis. Over the years, our scope has expanded to encompass review of other areas including neuropathic pain and Alzheimer’s disease, and types of research such as in vitro. More recently our work has also investigated metaresearch more broadly and research improvement. At CAMARADES, we’ve been at the forefront of preclinical systematic review, conducting our research and providing invaluable support to other research groups engaged in systematic review endeavours. Our collaborative ethos extends globally, fostering partnerships with researchers worldwide, including meta-researchers, preclinical researchers, clinicians, pharmaceutical companies, publishers, funders, and policymakers. Upon joining our team, it’s essential to familiarise yourself with this cookbook. We understand it’s comprehensive, so feel free to digest it gradually over your initial days with us. We expect you to be acquainted with its contents and to refer back to it as needed. Should you require clarification on any aspect of the cookbook, don’t hesitate to engage with your fellow team members. While this manual serves as a foundational resource, fostering a positive experience will also involve active engagement and ongoing refinement of our interactions. Remember, this cookbook is a living document. Your input matters, so if you have suggestions for additions or clarifications, please share them with the team.

The easiest way to edit the team handbook is via the GitHub user interface. Navigate to the webpage of the public repository. Click on the .Rmd file you want to edit. Keep in mind that each .Rmd file corresponds to one chapter. The welcome page text is found in index.Rmd, while all other files are named after the corresponding chapter e.g. 01-group-culture.Rmd or 02-team.Rmd. Click on ‘Edit this file’. Add/edit content of file. The easiest way to do this is to write plain text and use simple Markdown syntax for formatting (e.g., to add (sub)headings, format italics or bold, add hyperlinks or pictures, bullet points etc). If unsure, you could have a look at how other files of the handbook are formatted or consult this or this Markdown cheat sheet. Please don’t hesitate to ask for support from the team if there any issues/questions. Once you’re happy with your changes click the ‘Commit changes’ button. You will be prompted to add a commit message. This should be a short and ideally informative message about the changes you’ve made to the file.
