# File management

We aim for data organisation to be clear and as consistent as possible between projects -- to help with locating files, prevent data loss, and ensure that data can be findable, accessible, and used/re-used (both by yourself and others in the team).

To ensure consistent data organisation across projects, we recommend following the principles below:

## File storage

All CAMARADES projects data and documents should be stored on CAMARADES Berlin SharePoint as the primary location rather than on a local computer or personal accounts. You receive access to this when your contract starts. 

Generally for new projects, a folder should be creatred within 'General' in CAMARADES SharePoint. The exception would be for projects involving other organisations (where there may have been agreement to store/share data elsewhere), projects with sensitive data, or projects with existing folders within the main CAMARADES SharePoint directory.
Sensitive data such as interview recordings should only be stored on the Charit√©-managed S-drive (AG McCann / CAMARADES Berlin).

Depending on data/file being stored, you may wish to routinely create backups elsewhere, e.g. OSF for documents/data; GitHub for code.

## Folder structure on SharePoint
(proposal to discuss)

- Education
- General
  - admin, CAMARADES global, logos/templates, misc projects, presentations, conferences, writing retreats etc
- Grants
  - applications, grant admin, documentation/info from funders, list of funding opportunities
- Methods support
- Projects
  - one folder per project (COReS, INFORM, attac, sex diff, stroke comorb, in vitro, etc)

## Standardise folder management

## Maintain a living project document per project

## Follow naming conventions

## Data documentation

## Version control using GitHub
