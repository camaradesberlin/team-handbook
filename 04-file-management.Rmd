# File management

We aim for data organisation to be clear and as consistent as possible between projects -- to help with locating files, prevent data loss, and ensure that data can be findable, accessible, and used/re-used (both by yourself and others in the team).

To ensure consistent data organisation across projects, we recommend following the principles below:

## Storage

All CAMARADES projects data and documents should be stored on CAMARADES Berlin SharePoint as the primary location rather than on a local computer or personal accounts. You receive access to this when your contract starts. 

Generally for new projects, a folder should be creatred within 'General' in CAMARADES SharePoint. The exception would be for projects involving other organisations (where there may have been agreement to store/share data elsewhere), projects with sensitive data, or projects with existing folders within the main CAMARADES SharePoint directory.
Sensitive data such as interview recordings should only be stored on the Charité-managed S-drive (AG McCann / CAMARADES Berlin).

Depending on data/file being stored, you may wish to routinely create backups elsewhere, e.g. OSF for documents/data; GitHub for code.

### Folder structure on SharePoint
(proposal to discuss)

- Education
- General
  - admin, CAMARADES global, logos/templates, misc projects, presentations, conferences, writing retreats etc
- Grants
  - applications, grant admin, documentation/info from funders, list of funding opportunities
- Methods support
- Projects
  - one folder per project (COReS, INFORM, attac, sex diff, stroke comorb, in vitro, etc)

## File organisation

### File naming convention

ProjectName_FileDescription_Date_Version[Draft/Final] or ProjectName_FileDescriptor_YYYYMMDD_VersionNumber
e.g. StrokeComorb_invitroProtocol_2023-01-26_v02Draft.docx

### General rules 

- Don't use overly long filenames, use the minimum characters to include enough descriptive information in a filename
- Avoid special characters such as &*%$£°{! @ which can be reserved for specific tasks depending on the operating systems
- Use the underscore character instead of the point or the space, the latter two being able to be interpreted differently according to the operating systems
- Include as much descriptive information as possible to help identify the file, regardless of where it is stored
- Include the date in all file names, formatted according to the international standard ISO 8601: YYYY-MM-DD (year-month-day)
- The version number of a record should be indicated in its file name by the inclusion of 'v' followed the version number (2 digit format) and, where applicable, 'Draft' or 'Final'.
- Rather consider that the applications and instruments that could access the files are not case sensitive. In other words, consider by default that DATA and Data and data are identical.
- Use extensions (.xls, .ssd, .txt, etc.) in all lowercase (I.e., do not use .PDF or .Pdf) whenever possible to meaningfully reflect the software environment in which the file was created.
- Avoid keeping all intermediate versions of the same file. Too many different versions of the same file can be confusing to you and others.

## Version control using GitHub

For SR projects involving programming, maintain at least one active Github repository per project on [camaradesberlin](https://github.com/camaradesberlin/) with scripts and version control. Access can be set to private.

NB: be careful with sensitive information when uploading to GitHub. Store any configuration/credential details separately and do not upload this to GitHub.
