# File management

There are different options to safe files for employees. The location to where we store data depends on who is supposed to be using it and whether it entails sensitive data. In general, CAMARADES commits to an open and collaborative working attitude. Therefore, we safe most of our files either in a cloud storage or in an open repository such as osf.io or github. Most of our data are stored on the [CAMARADES sharepoint] (https://charitede.sharepoint.com/sites/StrokeCoMorb). Sensitive data containing information that might be sensitive (patient data but also contracts) should not be safed on the sharepoint. The BIH offers servers to store data which receive a regular backup. Please contact other team members to discuss whether any data you produce or store should be safed there. For private data, you can either use the onedrive cloud service connected to your Charité e-mail address or use the Charité t: Server connected to your computer. You are the only one who can access the data there. Never safe data on any device provided to you by the BIH as sometimes the IT helpdesk might have to install something or recover your computer. There is no backup on your work computer.
