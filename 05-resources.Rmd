# Key resources
## BIH/QUEST administration
Everything you need to know about different administrative procedures like requesting sick days or annual leave, working hours, the infamous PEP system and many more QUEST level things can be found in the QUEST [wiki](https://quest-wiki.premier.charite.de/index.php/Category:QUEST_Office_Admin). We are constantly adding new info to the wiki (thanks to Friederike's initiative of a monthly Wiki happy hour), so if something you think is relevant is missing you are more than welcome to add it yourself. If the answer you are looking for is not on the wiki, you can email Ruth (ruth.woelpert@bih-charite.de) or Gabriela (gabriela.seidel@bih-charite.de) to ask for clarification.
